title: Lighting

Lighting is a pretty complex subject and a lot can be tweaked and tuned to get different results, but my approach so far has been to look for energy efficient full spectrum lights. This page is primarily intended to be a list of resources to get started in the subject.

- ### [LED Gardener](https://ledgardener.com/)

  Hands down the best information on how to build your own LED rigs. For my lights, I ended up following [this guide](https://ledgardener.com/diy-led-strip-build-designs-samsung-bridgelux) and using Bridgelux strips. Note: That guide talks about Bridgelux EB Gen 2, but there is now a Gen 3 that is slightly more efficient, but twice as much.

- ### [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/)

  I've found DigiKey to be a pretty good supplier of LED parts. They sell both LEDs and Drivers to run them, along with A LOT of other electronic supplies.
