<h3>How to Take Your Grav Website Temporarily Offline</h3>

<p>There may be occasions when you will make your Grav website completely unavailable to visitors for a short time. There is a simple switch in the Administrator back-end that enables you to take your website offline very quickly. It can be returned to service at a later time just as easily.</p>

  <li> Click in the top right corner on the <strong>Extras</strong> button and select <strong>Platform Settings</strong>.</li>
  <li> Find where it says <strong>Offline</strong> and select the <strong>Yes</strong> switch.</li>

  <li> Click the <strong>Save</strong> button on the top right to implement the new settings.</li>
  <li>You should see a message confirming the settings have been changed.</li>
