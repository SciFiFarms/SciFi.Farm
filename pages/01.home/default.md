# Welcome!
This site contains the documentation needed to run a SciFi Farm. 

!!! This documentation isn't complete. There are still a fair number of pages I'd like to write but haven't yet. Things like Seedship parts list and working with ESPHome are at the top of the list. If there is anything you'd like to see, let me know via a GitHub issue. For now, I've disabled all the empty pages, so if you see a link, it should have content.

It's split into 4 main topics:

* [Seedships and Pictures](../seedships)  
    Seedships are open source automated environments to grow plants in. It contains instructions on using the automation and information on building the environments.

* [Using TechnoCore](../technocore)   
    TechnoCore is a tool to assist in deploying services via Docker. It is how you install the software needed to run a SciFi Farm.   
    
* [CEA: Controlled Environment Agriculture](../cea)  
    Information on plants, how they grow, and how that's impacted by being indoors. It contains information on aeroponics, lights, nutrients, and various plants.  
    
* [Developing TechnoCore](../dev)  
    If you're interested in how TechnoCore works under the covers or would like to contribute, this is for you! Everyone else can bugger off.
