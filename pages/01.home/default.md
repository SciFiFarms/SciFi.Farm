# Welcome!
This site contains the documentation needed to run a SciFi Farm. It's split into 4 main topics:

* [Using TechnoCore](../technocore)   
    TechnoCore is a tool to assist in deploying services via Docker. It is how you install the software needed to run a SciFi Farm.   
    
* [Seedships](../seedships)  
    Seedships are open source automated enviorments to grow plants in.   
    
* [CEA: Controlled Enviornment Agriculture](../cea)  
    Information on plants, how they grow, and how that's impacted by being indoors. It contains information on aeroponics, lights, nutrients, and various plants.  
    
* [Developing TechnoCore](../dev)  
    If you're interested in how TechnoCore works under the covers or would like to contribute, this is for you! Everyone else can bugger off.
